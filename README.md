* Clone the forked repo

> eg @+id/register_button

## Additional Rules

* Every PRs should be made to dev_test branch
* Don't add any color to the project until it is confirmed for you that the color is not on the project already, that means I have added colors already.
* Don't add any drawables to the project until I confirm that the drawable should be added, that means drawable has been added already.
* Don't create any class outside a package. Every class should be in it's appropriate package, if you're confuse, ask **Oluwajuwon**  for clarification.
* Always pull before you push. If you have any challenges, seek for help from any of the mobile guys here.
* Let's work in Love, Peace and Harmony :tada: :sparkles:
